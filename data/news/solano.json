      "summary": "California has reopened for business as of June 15, 2021, meaning everyday life should feel a lot like before COVID-19. Restaurants, shopping malls, movie theaters, and most everyday places will be open as usual with no capacity limits or social distancing required. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) has indicated masking guidelines are revised, and face coverings are no longer required for fully vaccinated persons when outdoors or indoors in public spaces except as required by local businesses or Cal/OSHA. Anyone can still wear a mask if they would like, especially around children and others who are vulnerable or not yet eligible for vaccination."
